# ATLAN-Search The IPL
## Given Task:
Create a discovery page for IPL where users can search & use facet filters to find different entities â€“ players, teams, owners & venus. Users should be able to filter based on any attributes related to the entity. Make it as easy, intuitive and as less steps as possible for the user to reach a particular entity.

## ReactJS is used in this task.

## Data
As given in the task, I have used data from https://www.kaggle.com/ramjidoolla/ipl-data-set
I have converted CSV files into JSON so that data can be easily rendered on Frontend. Also, I have used react-bootstrap for ease in CSS and used react-router-dom for routing purpose.

## Page Load Time

Page load time in the Chrome's window is `2.0` seconds. After searching multiple tools, the best tool which I found from multiple resources is `Google PageSpeed Insights`. So, I tested my website on Google PageSpeed Insights and my website scored 98 out of 100.
